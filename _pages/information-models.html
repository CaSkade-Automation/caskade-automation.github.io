<p>
	In today's dynamic manufacturing landscape, the role of information is pivotal. CaSkade contributes to this field with a unique focus on capabilities and skills, centering our efforts around semantic information models.
</p>

<h2>The Role of Information Models in CaSkade</h2>
<p>
	In an industry where both adaptability and precision are crucial, information models form the underpinning of our framework. Here’s why they matter:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Detailed Roadmaps:</b> Our information models are akin to detailed roadmaps, guiding each step of the manufacturing
    process. They intricately link the capabilities of systems to the specific skills required, ensuring thorough planning and execution.</li>
  <li><b>Flexibility and Versatility:</b> CaSkade’s models are built to adapt, allowing for integration with a variety of manufacturing needs. This flexibility ensures that our approach can be useful in diverse settings.</li>
  <li><b>Commitment to Precision:</b> At CaSkade, we strive for precision. Our models aim to align capabilities with the appropriate skills, helping to streamline processes and reduce inefficiencies.</li>
  <li><b>Fostering Communication:</b> A key aspect of CaSkade is enhancing communication and teamwork in manufacturing environments. Our models are designed to aid in clear and effective collaboration.</li>
  <li><b>Embracing Future Trends:</b> While CaSkade is grounded in current manufacturing needs, we also aim to stay attuned to emerging technologies and trends, preparing for the future landscape of manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of our models</h2>
<p>
	Our information models are based on the <a class="text-link" href="css">CSS reference model</a> of Plattform Industry 4.0. This reference model is developed by working groups with participants from various companies and research institutes and provides the essential classes and relations of our model.
	Based on this purely conceptual model, a multi-level ontology architecture was developed.
	This architecture consists of an ontology at the top level, which initially maps the model elements of the CSS reference model 1:1 in the form of an OWL ontology. No further elements are initially added; the CSS ontology represents a reference implementation of the CSS reference model.
